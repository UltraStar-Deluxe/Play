### About
[UltraStar Play](https://usplay.net/) is a free and open source singing game.
The game plays an audio file, displays lyrics, notes, and optionally a background video or image, while the players sing along to earn points.

UltraStar Play is built with the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine and mostly C# as programming language.
Builds are available for [desktop and mobile](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/releases).
Even more platforms (e.g. tvOS, PlayStation, XBox) might be added in the future.

See [the project wiki](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/wiki/First-Steps) to get started.
